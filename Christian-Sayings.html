Next to the Word of God, the next best place to get encouragement is through Christian sayings. 
<p>

These spiritual sayings can help pull me back to what's really important about caring for my baby.  
<p>
They also help lay a strong foundation for me to build on as she grows up. <p>
<b>Use these spiritual sayings 
to help provide good counsel and strong encouragement in your path of parenthood.</b>
<p>
Although these Christian sayings and quotations are encouraging, enlightening, and perhaps convicting, 
they do not supplant the need to immerse ourselves in God's Word itself. 
<p>
<a href="Famous-Bible-Quotes.html" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">Here are some passages from God's 
Word to help you get started.</a>  Start with Biblical principles and truth, and then add on the wisdom 
and counsel of others who base that wisdom on that same truth.

<li class="custom"><img src="image-files/new.jpg" width="40" height="18" title="" alt="new"/>Have you been propping up that foolish soul 
of yours with the idea that your circumstances are too much for God to handle?  Set all your opinions and speculations aside and "abide 
under the shadow of the Almighty" (Psalm 91:1).  Deliberately tell God that you will not fret about whatever concerns you.  All our 
fretting and worrying is caused by planning without God. <i>~ Oswald Chambers</i>

<li class="custom">Children's talking, thinking and reasoning are, by definition, immature. They are often inconsistent. 
Their thinking can be arbitrary, simple and naïve. These qualities of children and youth are not in

<h2>Christian Sayings By J.C. Ryle</h2>


The following Christian sayings and quotations are taken from J. C. Ryle's book, <i>The Duties of Parents. </i> 
<p>
<b>This
little pamphlet-sized book (it's only 38 pages) is jam-packed with valuable wisdom for parents.</b>
<p>
<a href="Books-General.html" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">You can purchase a copy of this book at The Essential Infant Book Emporium</a>, an Amazon.com affiliate bookstore.  
<p>
At $3.25 it's one of the best parenting investments you can make.
<p><hr class="dashed">

<h3>About Conversion...</h3>
<i>I know that you cannot convert your child. I know well that they who are born again are born, not of the 
will of man but of God. 
<p>
But I also know that God says expressly, 'Train up a child in the way in which he 
should go,' and that he never laid a command on man which he would not give man grace to perform. 
<p>
And I 
know, too, that our duty is not to stand still and dispute, but to go forward and obey. 
<p>
<b>It is in this going 
forward that God will meet us. The path of obedience is the way in which he gives his blessing.</b> 
<p>
We have only
 to do as the servants were commanded at the marriage feast in Canaan, to fill the water-pots with water and
  we may safely leave it to the Lord to turn that water into wine.</i>
<hr class="dashed">
<h3>About Training...</h3>
<i>To my eyes, a parent always yielding, and a child always having its own way, are a most painful sight -- 
painful because I see God's appointed order of things inverted and turned upside down; -- painful because 
I feel sure the consequence to that child's character in the end will be self-will, pride and self-conceit?
<p>

And do not be afraid, above all, that such a plan of training will make your child unhappy. I warn you 
against this delusion. 
<p>
Depend on it, <b>there is no surer road to unhappiness than always having your own way.</b>
<p>

 To have our wills checked and denied is a blessed thing for us; it makes us value enjoyments when they 
 come. 
 <p>
 To be indulged perpetually is the way to be made selfish; and selfish people and spoiled children, 
 believe me, are seldom happy.</i>
 <hr class="dashed">
<h3> About Love...</h3>
 

<i>Train up your child with all tenderness, affection, and patience. I do not mean that you are to spoil him, 
but I do mean that you should let him see that you love him. 
<p>
<b>Love should be the silver thread that runs 
through all your conduct.</b> 
<p>
Kindness, gentleness, long-suffering, forbearance, patience, sympathy, a 
willingness to enter into childish troubles, a readiness to take part in childish joys, -- these are the 
cords by which a child may be led most easily, -- these are the clues you must follow if you would find the 
way to his heart.</i>
 <hr class="dashed">
<h3>About Kindness...</h3>
<i>Children's minds are cast in much the same mold as our own. Sternness and severity of manner chill them and 
throw them back. It shuts up their hearts, and you will weary yourself to find the door. 
<p>
But let them only 
see that you have an affectionate feeling towards them, -- that you are really desirous to make them happy, 
and do them goodlet them see this, I say<b>Work hard to keep up a hold on your child's affections.</b>
<p></i>
<hr class="dashed">
<h2>Already a Christian?</h2>
<b>Add knowledge to your faith.  </b>God loves learners.  He invites discussions!  He created us with a mind and is pleased
when we use it.   Visit <a href="http://www.Apologetics.com" target="_blank" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">Apologetics.com <i>(Challenging Believers to Think and Thinkers to Believe)</a></i>
to educate yourself on... 
<ul><p>
<li class="custom">the deeper waters of our faith
<li class="custom">the history of our faith 
<li class="custom">how our culture effects our faith
<li class="custom">how our faith should effect our culture</ul>

What does this have to do with infants?  Infants grow into toddlers, and eventually teenagers.  Solid teaching
in these early years will make staying on the right path in the later ones more likely.  
<p>
I like to download their podcasts (it's free) on my ipod and listen while I'm folding laundry or cooking supper.
<b>Find time to learn.</b>
<p>
 The greatest gift we could ever hope to share and the biggest blessing we could ever hope to receive is to 
 have our children walking close to Jesus.  <b>If your walk isn't close to Jesus, how can you expect theirs to be?</b>
